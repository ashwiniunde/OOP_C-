Polymorphism in C++  ::
The word polymorphism means having many forms.

Types of Polymorphism ::

1. Compile-time Polymorphism

    A. Function Overloading => two or more functions can have the  same name
                             but behave differently for different parameters

    B. Operator Overloading => ability to provide the operators with a special
                             meaning for particular data type

2. Runtime Polymorphism 
The function call in runtime polymorphism is resolved at 
runtime in contrast with compile time polymorphism.
